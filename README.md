# COCO_Plus
This API adds more functionalities to the original [COCO API](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi).
These functionalities include adding more samples with annotation to the COCO 
dataset or creating a new dataset with the same format as the COCO dataset. The
original COCO API must be installed before you can use the COCO_Plus API.

## Installation
- Install [pycocotools](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi) to your Python site-packages
- Import the coco_plus class:
  ```python
  from coco_plus import COCO_PLUS
  ```
